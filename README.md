#shared-dictionaries
This repository contains only dictionaries that are not included in [GBIF parsers](https://github.com/gbif/parsers).
For all geography related files, this dictionary-based approach (hosted on GitHub) is a transition solution until we move to data provided by geonames.org.

## Assumptions
To simplify the usage of the dictionary files, we assume: 
 * Dictionaries files lookup ignores separators except space(s)
 * Dictionaries files lookup ignores accentuated character(s)
